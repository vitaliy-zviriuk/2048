  3.  In this project, I created a clone of the 2048 game, learned to manipulate the DOM,      
      handle user events, and implement game logic such as tile sliding, merging, and random    
      tile generation. I also managed game state, tracked scores, and handled win/loss conditions.      
  4.  Technologies that were used: HTML, JavaScript, Scss.
